💳✨ Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent transactions 🕵️‍♂️ in credit card data using machine learning models. Developed in Google Colab 🌐, it involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and the implementation of various models to accurately classify transactions as fraudulent or non-fraudulent.

🔍 Features

Google Colab Environment: Cloud-based development ☁️, so no local setup is needed.

Data Preprocessing: 🛠️ Handles missing values, scales data, and addresses class imbalances using SMOTE.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): 📊 Visualizes key patterns and relationships in the dataset to provide meaningful insights.

Modeling: 🤖 Implements machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest to detect fraud.

Model Evaluation: 🏆 Evaluates models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure optimal fraud detection performance.

⚙️ Requirements

Since this project runs in Google Colab, there is no need for local installations 🚀. However, the following libraries are automatically installed in the Colab environment:

pandas 🐼

numpy 🔢

matplotlib 📉

scikit-learn 🧠

🚀 How to Run

Open the notebook in Google Colab 🌐 by uploading it from this repository.

Execute each cell sequentially to:

Preprocess the data 🛠️

Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis 📊

Train and evaluate machine learning models 🧠

Analyze the results and metrics for fraud detection performance 📈.

🎯 Results

The best-performing model identifies fraudulent transactions with high precision 🔍 and recall, reducing false positives while maintaining accuracy in detecting fraud 💥.
